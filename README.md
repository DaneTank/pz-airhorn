Added an air horn to the game to make noise and attract zombies, a great mod for those who don't want to waste ammo while being mobile

## Motivation

In an episode of The Walking Dead we can see Daryl using the Air Horn to attract the horde, I wanted to integrate this item into the game for my first mod
