Air horn is a simple mod for Project Zomboid that adds an item which makes a lot of noise and attracts zombies. It is great for saving ammunition and constantly staying on the move.

## Motivation

In an episode of The Walking Dead we can see Daryl using an air horn to attract the horde. 
I wanted to integrate this item into the game for my first mod
